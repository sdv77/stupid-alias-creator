### How to use:

1. Clone repository and `cd` into it
2. Make file executable:
```bash
chmod +x alias.sh
```
3. Run it
```bash
./alias.sh
```
> Or just copy-paste my script and create the file yourself — whatever you like
> 
> This version has zero error checking or anything like that, so maybe later I'll add it (or not xdd)

### How to delete alias?
> Later i'll create script for that
> 
Delete alias in the end of the file `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

U can check that by `echo $SHELL`
